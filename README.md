# ATM-Machine
Introduction<br>
As a Computer Science Engineering student, I had the opportunity to undertake a one-month internship at Yotta Data Services. During this period, I worked on a project that involved designing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) with an integrated email gateway. This experience has significantly enhanced my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, GUI development, and the utilisation of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email communication.

Project Overview
The primary objective of my project was to create a user-friendly GUI for an ATM system that could handle basic banking transactions such as creating pins, withdrawals, deposits , checking balance and changing existing pins . Additionally, the system needed to have an integrated email gateway to send transaction notifications to users. The project required the integration of the following key components: 

1. GUI Development : Using Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit in Python, I designed the interface. The GUI included elements such as buttons, text fields, and labels to facilitate user interactions.

2. OOP in Python : To structure the application, I implemented Object-Oriented Programming principles. The  class encapsulated relevant properties and methods, promoting modularity and code reusability.

3. Email Gateway Integration : The email functionality was implemented using Pythonâ€™s `smtplib` library. This enabled the system to send emails automatically upon completion of transactions. I configured the SMTP settings to connect with an email server, ensuring secure and reliable email delivery.

Learning Outcomes
- Enhanced OOP Skills : Prior to this internship, my knowledge of OOP was primarily theoretical. Working on this project allowed me to apply OOP concepts practically. I learned to design and implement classes, manage object instances, and use inheritance and polymorphism to create a robust and scalable application.
  
- GUI Development : This project was my first substantial experience with GUI development in Python. I became proficient in using Tkinter, understanding widget properties, layout management, and event handling. I also learned how to create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, which is crucial for enhancing user experience.

- Email Gateway and SMTP : Implementing the email gateway was a valuable learning experience. I gained insights into how email protocols work and how to use the `smtplib` library to send emails programmatically. This included configuring the SMTP server, handling authentication, and ensuring email security.
